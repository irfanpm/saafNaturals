Saaf Naturals - Coconut Production Company Website
Welcome to the Saaf Naturals website project! This application is built to showcase our premium coconut-based products, provide insights into our sustainable production processes, and connect with customers and partners. We use modern web technologies to deliver a fast, scalable, and content-managed experience.

To build this app, weâ€™re using the following technologies:

Next.js - A React framework for production, enabling a full-stack application with server-side rendering and static site generation.
Cosmic - A Headless CMS that separates content management from the frontend, allowing us to easily update product details, production stats, and company info.
Sass - A powerful CSS extension language for styling our website with modular, reusable, and professional-grade design.
